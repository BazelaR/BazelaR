### 🚀 Project: History Imposter
A collaborative project developed during **DurHack X (2025)** — inspired by the themes *"Legacy"* and *"Bridging Worlds"*.

### 🧩 Overview
**History Imposter** is an educational, game-based learning experience where players interact with AI agents impersonating historical figures.  
The goal is to outsmart 4 AI characters while learning real-world facts and stories from global history — making education interactive, fun, and inclusive.

### 💡 My Contribution
I focused on **research and content development**, ensuring the historical context and learning elements were accurate, engaging, and age-appropriate.  
I also contributed to concept design, documentation, and team coordination.

### 🧰 Tech Stack
`Python` · `Flask` · `OpenAI API` · `DigitalOcean` · `GradientAI`

### 🔍 Key Learnings
- Collaborating in a **multidisciplinary tech team**  
- Researching and integrating **educational content with AI systems**  
- Understanding **frontend–backend communication**  
- Exploring **Generative AI APIs** for interactive learning  
- Managing ambitious project scopes within short hackathon timeframes  

### 🏆 Achievements
- Successfully merged backend logic with chatbot-style frontend  
- Helped design a game concept that connects *education*, *history*, and *AI*  
- Learned the importance of **team synergy** and **adaptive problem-solving** under pressure  

### 🔮 What’s Next
We plan to expand History Imposter by:
- Adding more playable historical figures  
- Refining AI prompts for better engagement  
- Hosting the game on a public site for continued learning
